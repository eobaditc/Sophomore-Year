Homework 02 - Grading
=====================

**Score**: 14 / 15

Deductions
----------
**Activity 1:**

- **\#2.** -1.0 **--** When checking disk usage of a directory, make sure to use *du*, not *ls*. Use *du* and you will see that the directory actually only uses ~10M.
This is not surprising because the hard links just store references to existing inodes and dont copy the contents of the file.

Good work!
